# Mental-Health-App
Its a small game on Mental Health. We have to play the game and scores would keep getting added. The scores would tell how your mental health condition is. If the score is 8 or more, then you are absolutely fine, if 4-8 then you are okay with little worries, if less than 4, then it means your mental health is not very good.
